                  chartering business, as most Charter agencies will
                  advice correctly but some may not be so aware of
                  the consequences or risks ahead when not
                  complying.</p>

                  high net worth yacht owners regarding maritime
                  regulations, providing them with misleading
                  advice. This exploitation is deeply concerning, as
                  it can lead to serious consequences for both the
                  owners and their guests. At our organization, we
                  shed light on such practices and advocate for

                  responsibilities once they have received their commissions.
                  Despite their extensive knowledge of maritime regulations,
                  we rarely see them taking proactive steps to ensure
                  compliance or return commissions when necessary.</p>
